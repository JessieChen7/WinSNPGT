# ___WinSNPGT: Genotyping of specified SNP sites on windows system___

## ðŸ‘‰ Latest [release package](https://github.com/JessieChen7/WinSNPGT/raw/installation_package/WinSNPGT.exe)

## ðŸ’¡ General Introduction
The rapid development of sequencing technology and dramatic drop in the cost have led to the generation of massive amounts of data. However, most of the raw data are analyzed on linux systems, and the process of generating variant loci information from sequencing data is a challenge for researchers unfamiliar with linux systems. We have developed a toolkit to call variant loci on the windows system, WinSNPGT. It can obtain the genotypes of the raw sequencing data for the snp loci specified in our datasets. The installation and use of this toolkit is described below.
